# Copy this file to additional_environment.rb and add any statements
# that need to be passed to the Rails::Initializer.  `config` is
# available in this context.
#
# Example:
#
#   config.log_level = :debug
#   ...
#
# Determine plugins loading priorities, least priorities will be loaded sooner
# , undefined priorities will default to 0
# Loading priority relies that plugin directory name is equals to its id
#
# Ex:
#
# config.plugins_load_order = {
#     plugin_1: -2,
#     plugin_2: -1,
#     plugin_3: 1
# }
